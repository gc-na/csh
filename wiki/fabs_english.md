# fabs Function in C: The Absolute Value of a Floating Point Number

## Synopsis
The `fabs` function in C is a standard library function that computes the absolute value of a floating-point number. It is defined in the `<math.h>` header file and is widely used in mathematical computations where the magnitude of a number is required without regard to its sign.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `fabs` function is designed to return the absolute value of a given floating-point number (of type `double`). This is particularly useful in mathematical applications where negative values need to be converted to their positive counterparts for calculations such as distance, magnitude, or any scenario where only positive values are meaningful.

### Usage
To use the `fabs` function, include the `<math.h>` header at the beginning of your C program. The function prototype is as follows:

```c
double fabs(double x);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `x`: The floating-point number whose absolute value is to be computed.
  
- **Returns**: 
  - The function returns the absolute value of `x`. If `x` is NaN (Not a Number), it returns NaN as well.

### Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating the usage of `fabs`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double num1 = -5.3;
    double num2 = 4.2;

    printf("The absolute value of %.2f is %.2f\n", num1, fabs(num1)); // Outputs: 5.30
    printf("The absolute value of %.2f is %.2f\n", num2, fabs(num2)); // Outputs: 4.20

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `fabs` function is called with both negative and positive values, showcasing its ability to handle both cases correctly.

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
1. **Including the Correct Header**: Make sure to include `<math.h>`, as failure to do so will result in a compilation error due to the undefined reference to `fabs`.
  
2. **Return Type**: The return type of `fabs` is `double`. If you are working with `float` or `long double`, you should use `fabsf` or `fabsl` respectively to ensure type safety and to avoid potential loss of precision.

3. **Handling NaN**: If you pass NaN to `fabs`, the function will return NaN. Ensure that your code can appropriately handle such cases if they are possible in your calculations.

4. **Linking with Math Library**: When compiling your program, you may need to link against the math library using the `-lm` flag (e.g., `gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c -lm`).

### Additional Notes
- The `fabs` function is part of the ANSI C standard, making it portable across different compilers and platforms that support C.
- The function is optimized for performance in mathematical computations, making it a preferred choice for scientific applications.

## One Line Summary
The `fabs` function in C computes and returns the absolute value of a floating-point number, ensuring accurate mathematical operations regardless of the input sign.
