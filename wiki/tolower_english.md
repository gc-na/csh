# Using the `tolower` Function in C: A Complete Guide

## Synopsis
The `tolower` function in C is used to convert a given character to its lowercase equivalent if it is an uppercase letter. It is part of the C Standard Library and is included in the `<ctype.h>` header.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `tolower` function is to facilitate case conversion in strings or individual characters. This is especially useful in text processing, where uniformity in character casing is necessary.

### Usage
To use the `tolower` function, you need to include the `<ctype.h>` header file in your program. The function takes a single argument of type `int`, which represents the character to be converted, and returns the lowercase equivalent if the character is an uppercase letter. If the argument is not an uppercase letter, it is returned unchanged.

**Function Prototype:**
```c
int tolower(int c);
```

### Parameters
- `c`: An integer representation of the character to be converted. It is typically passed as a character cast to `int`.

### Return Value
- If `c` is an uppercase letter ('A' to 'Z'), `tolower` returns the corresponding lowercase letter ('a' to 'z').
- If `c` is not an uppercase letter, it returns `c` unchanged.

## Examples
Here are some basic examples of how to use the `tolower` function:

### Example 1: Single Character Conversion
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main() {
    char upper = 'G';
    char lower = tolower(upper);
    printf("Lowercase of %c is %c\n", upper, lower);
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Lowercase of G is g
```

### Example 2: Converting a String
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

void convertToLower(const char *str) {
    while (*str) {
        putchar(tolower(*str));
        str++;
    }
}

int main() {
    const char *text = "Hello, World!";
    convertToLower(text);
    return 0;
}
```
**Output:**
```
hello, world!
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls and Gotchas
- **Non-Character Input**: The `tolower` function expects an `int` that can represent any character in the current locale. Passing values outside the range of `unsigned char` or the special value `EOF` may lead to undefined behavior.
- **Locale Sensitivity**: The behavior of `tolower` may vary depending on the current locale set in the program. For instance, some characters may have different lowercase representations based on cultural norms. To ensure consistent behavior, consider setting a specific locale using the `setlocale()` function from `<locale.h>`.
- **Overuse on Non-alpha Characters**: Applying `tolower` on numbers or symbols does not yield any changes, which might lead to confusion if not understood correctly.

## One Line Summary
The `tolower` function in C converts uppercase letters to lowercase, returning unchanged characters for non-uppercase inputs.
