# Understanding the `sqrt` Function in C: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `sqrt` function in C is a standard library function that computes the square root of a given non-negative double-precision floating-point number, returning the result as a double. This function is essential for mathematical computations that require square root calculations.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `sqrt` function is used to calculate the square root of a number. It is included in the C Standard Library, specifically in the `<math.h>` header file. This function is vital in various applications, including scientific computations, engineering calculations, and graphics programming.

### Usage
To use the `sqrt` function, include the `<math.h>` header at the beginning of your program. The function can be called with the following syntax:

```c
double sqrt(double x);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `x`: A non-negative double value for which the square root is to be calculated.
  
- **Return Value**: 
  - Returns the square root of `x` as a double.
  - If `x` is negative, the behavior is undefined, and typically a domain error occurs.

### Example
Hereâ€™s a simple example demonstrating how to use the `sqrt` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double number = 25.0;
    double result;

    result = sqrt(number);
    printf("The square root of %.2f is %.2f\n", number, result);

    return 0;
}
```

### Output:
```
The square root of 25.00 is 5.00
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls and Gotchas
1. **Negative Input**: Passing a negative value to `sqrt` leads to undefined behavior, which may cause the program to crash or produce an incorrect result. Always ensure that the input is non-negative.
   
2. **Floating-Point Precision**: Due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic, results may not always be precise. Be wary of comparing floating-point numbers for equality.

3. **Include `<math.h>`**: Forgetting to include the `<math.h>` header will result in compilation errors, as the `sqrt` function will not be recognized.

4. **Linking with `-lm`**: If you are using GCC or similar compilers, ensure you link the math library by using the `-lm` flag during compilation. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc my_program.c -o my_program -lm
   ```

## One Line Summary
The `sqrt` function in C computes the square root of a non-negative double and is a standard utility in mathematical operations.
