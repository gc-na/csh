# Understanding the `tanh` Function in C: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `tanh` function in C computes the hyperbolic tangent of a given floating-point number, which is essential in various mathematical, engineering, and scientific applications.

## Documentation
The `tanh` function is part of the C standard library, specifically included in the `<math.h>` header file. It is utilized to calculate the hyperbolic tangent of a specified value, returning a value in the range of -1 to 1.

### Purpose
The primary purpose of the `tanh` function is to return the hyperbolic tangent of a floating-point number. The hyperbolic tangent is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{tanh}(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} \]

### Usage
To use the `tanh` function in C, include the `<math.h>` header file in your program. The function prototype is defined as follows:

```c
double tanh(double x);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `x`: A double-precision floating-point number for which the hyperbolic tangent is to be calculated.
  
- **Return Value**: 
  - The function returns the hyperbolic tangent of `x`, which is a double.

### Example
Here is a basic example demonstrating the usage of the `tanh` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double value1 = 0.0;
    double value2 = 1.0;
    double value3 = -1.0;

    printf("tanh(%f) = %f\n", value1, tanh(value1)); // Output: 0.0
    printf("tanh(%f) = %f\n", value2, tanh(value2)); // Output: 0.761594
    printf("tanh(%f) = %f\n", value3, tanh(value3)); // Output: -0.761594

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation
When using the `tanh` function, it is important to be aware of the following:

- **Input Range**: The function can accept any real number as input, but be mindful that extremely large or small values might lead to precision issues due to the limitations of floating-point representation.
  
- **Return Value Range**: The output is always between -1 and 1, regardless of the input value. This makes `tanh` particularly useful in neural network applications, where outputs need to be normalized.

- **Library Linkage**: When compiling a program that uses `tanh`, ensure to link against the math library by using the `-lm` flag in your compilation command. For example:
  ```bash
  gcc -o my_program my_program.c -lm
  ```

- **Common Pitfalls**: 
  - Forgetting to include `<math.h>` will lead to compilation errors as the function prototype will be unknown.
  - Not using the `-lm` flag during compilation might result in linker errors.

## One Line Summary
The `tanh` function in C calculates the hyperbolic tangent of a floating-point number, returning values between -1 and 1.
