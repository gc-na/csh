# Understanding the `ceil` Function in C: Rounding Up Floating-Point Numbers

## Synopsis
The `ceil` function in C is a mathematical function that rounds a given floating-point number up to the nearest integer, returning the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to the input.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `ceil` function is part of the C standard library, defined in the `<math.h>` header file. It is used for mathematical computations where rounding up is necessary, particularly in scenarios involving floating-point arithmetic.

### Usage
To use the `ceil` function, include the `<math.h>` header in your C program. The function prototype is as follows:

```c
double ceil(double x);
```

### Parameters
- **x**: A floating-point number of type `double` that you want to round up.

### Return Value
The function returns the smallest integer value (as a `double`) that is greater than or equal to `x`. If `x` is already an integer, it returns `x` unchanged.

### Example of Function Declaration
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double number = 3.14;
    double result = ceil(number);
    printf("The ceiling of %f is %f\n", number, result);
    return 0;
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double num1 = 2.3;
    double num2 = -2.3;
    
    printf("ceil(%.1f) = %.1f\n", num1, ceil(num1)); // Output: 3.0
    printf("ceil(%.1f) = %.1f\n", num2, ceil(num2)); // Output: -2.0

    return 0;
}
```

### Example 2: Using `ceil` in Calculations
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double price = 19.99;
    double tax_rate = 0.075; // 7.5% tax
    double total = price + (price * tax_rate);
    
    printf("Total before rounding: %.2f\n", total);
    printf("Total after applying ceil: %.0f\n", ceil(total)); // Rounds up to the nearest whole number

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
1. **Type Mismatch**: The `ceil` function expects a `double` argument. Passing an integer or other types may lead to implicit type conversions or unexpected results.
   
2. **Return Type**: Be aware that `ceil` returns a `double`, even though it represents an integer. This can lead to confusion in calculations if not handled properly.

3. **Negative Numbers**: While `ceil` rounds up towards zero for negative numbers, users may expect it to behave differently. For instance, `ceil(-2.3)` results in `-2.0`, which is indeed the smallest integer greater than `-2.3`.

### Additional Notes
- The `ceil` function is part of the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic.
- For very large or very small numbers, the precision of the result may depend on the implementation of the C standard library.

## One Line Summary
The `ceil` function in C rounds a floating-point number up to the nearest integer, ensuring the return of the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input value.
