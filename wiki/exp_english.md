# Using the `exp` Function in C: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `exp` function in C computes the exponential value of a given number, specifically \(e^x\), where \(e\) is Euler's number (approximately 2.71828). This function is part of the C standard library and is essential for mathematical computations involving exponential growth or decay.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `exp` function is used to calculate the exponential of a number. It is particularly useful in various fields such as mathematics, physics, and engineering, especially when dealing with exponential functions in formulas or algorithms.

### Usage
To use the `exp` function, include the `<math.h>` header file in your C program. The function signature is as follows:

```c
double exp(double x);
```

#### Parameters
- `x`: A `double` representing the exponent to which Euler's number will be raised.

#### Return Value
The function returns the value of \(e^x\). If the calculation results in a value that exceeds the range of `double`, the function may return `inf` (infinity). If the input is a negative infinity, it will return `0`.

### Example Code
Here are a few examples demonstrating the usage of the `exp` function in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>

int main() {
    double value1 = 1.0;
    double result1 = exp(value1);
    printf("exp(%.2f) = %.5f\n", value1, result1); // Output: exp(1.00) = 2.71828

    double value2 = 0.0;
    double result2 = exp(value2);
    printf("exp(%.2f) = %.5f\n", value2, result2); // Output: exp(0.00) = 1.00000

    double value3 = -1.0;
    double result3 = exp(value3);
    printf("exp(%.2f) = %.5f\n", value3, result3); // Output: exp(-1.00) = 0.36788

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
While using the `exp` function, it's important to note the following common pitfalls and gotchas:

- **Range Limitations**: The result of `exp(x)` can grow very large with positive values of `x`. For example, `exp(1000)` exceeds the maximum value representable by a `double`, leading to `inf`. Be cautious when dealing with large inputs.
  
- **Negative Inputs**: For negative values, such as `exp(-x)`, the function approaches zero but does not reach it. This can lead to underflow issues in some applications, especially when working with very large positive inputs.

- **Mathematical Domain**: The function accepts all real numbers as input, including negative and zero, but always check for the proper usage context in scientific computations.

- **Compiler Flags**: Ensure you compile your C program with the `-lm` flag to link the math library, as the `exp` function is part of this library.

## One Line Summary
The `exp` function in C computes the exponential value of a number, returning \(e^x\) for a given input \(x\).
