# Understanding `atexit`: Registering Exit Handlers in C

## Synopsis
The `atexit` function in C is used to register functions that will be called upon normal program termination, allowing for cleanup operations to be executed before the program exits.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `atexit` function enables developers to specify one or more functions that should be invoked at program termination. This is particularly useful for releasing resources, closing files, or performing other cleanup tasks that need to occur before the program exits.

### Usage
To use `atexit`, include the `<stdlib.h>` header file in your C program. The function signature is as follows:

```c
int atexit(void (*func)(void));
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `func`: A pointer to the function that you want to register. This function must take no arguments and return no value (void).
  
- **Return Value**: 
  - Returns `0` on success, and a non-zero value if the registration fails.

### Details
- Functions registered with `atexit` are called in the reverse order of their registration when `exit` is invoked or when the program terminates normally (e.g., reaching the end of `main`).
- If a function registered with `atexit` does not complete successfully or causes the program to terminate, subsequent exit handlers will not be executed.
- The maximum number of functions that can be registered with `atexit` is implementation-defined, but it is typically at least 32.

## Examples
### Example 1: Basic Usage
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void cleanup() {
    printf("Cleanup function called.\n");
}

int main() {
    if (atexit(cleanup) != 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to register cleanup function.\n");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }
    printf("Main function execution.\n");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

### Example 2: Multiple Functions
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void firstCleanup() {
    printf("First cleanup function called.\n");
}

void secondCleanup() {
    printf("Second cleanup function called.\n");
}

int main() {
    atexit(firstCleanup);
    atexit(secondCleanup);
    
    printf("Main function execution.\n");
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```
**Output:**
```
Main function execution.
Second cleanup function called.
First cleanup function called.
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Function Signatures**: Ensure that the functions registered with `atexit` have the correct signature (i.e., they should have a return type of `void` and no parameters).
- **Exit Conditions**: If the program terminates abnormally (via `exit` with a non-zero status or via signals like `SIGKILL`), registered functions may not be executed.
- **Memory Management**: If a registered function tries to access resources that have already been freed or closed, it may lead to undefined behavior.

### Additional Notes
- `atexit` is not thread-safe. If your program is multi-threaded, consider using other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety when registering exit functions.
- The functions registered with `atexit` cannot take parameters; if you need to pass parameters, consider using global or static variables.

## One Line Summary
The `atexit` function in C allows you to register cleanup functions that are executed at program termination, ensuring proper resource management.
