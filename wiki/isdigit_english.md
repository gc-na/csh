# Understanding `isdigit` in C: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `isdigit` function in C is used to determine if a given character is a decimal digit (0-9). It is part of the C standard library and is included in the `<ctype.h>` header.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `isdigit` function checks if a character falls within the range of decimal digits. This is particularly useful in input validation, parsing, and processing strings where numeric values are expected.

### Usage
To use `isdigit`, include the `<ctype.h>` header in your C program. The function prototype is as follows:

```c
int isdigit(int c);
```

**Parameters:**
- `c`: The character to be checked, passed as an `int`. This is typically the ASCII value of the character.

**Return Value:**
- Returns a non-zero value (true) if `c` is a digit (i.e., between '0' and '9').
- Returns 0 (false) if `c` is not a digit.

### Example Code
Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of `isdigit`:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main() {
    char inputChar;

    printf("Enter a character: ");
    scanf(" %c", &inputChar);

    if (isdigit(inputChar)) {
        printf("'%c' is a digit.\n", inputChar);
    } else {
        printf("'%c' is not a digit.\n", inputChar);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Character Encoding**: Ensure that the character you are checking is indeed an ASCII character. Non-ASCII characters might lead to unexpected results.
- **Passing Non-Character Values**: The `isdigit` function accepts an integer. Passing a value outside the range of unsigned char (0 to 255) can lead to undefined behavior.

### Additional Notes
- The `isdigit` function is often used in conjunction with functions like `isalpha` (for alphabetic characters) or `isalnum` (for alphanumeric characters) to validate input.
- It is recommended to use `isdigit` inside a conditional statement to handle different types of inputs gracefully.

## One Line Summary
The `isdigit` function in C checks if a character is a decimal digit and is essential for input validation in string processing.
